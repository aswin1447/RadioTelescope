RTL-SDR is a very cheap
USB dongle that can be
used as a computer based
radio scanner for receiving
live radio signals in your
area. Depending on the particular 
model it could receive 
frequencies from 500 kHz up 
to 1.75 GHz.


For rtl dongle to work on
a Linux machine ,the machine            
needed to be set-up .Download the
install.sh script in this folder
to do that or else you can read
the docs(rtl-sdr4linux.pdf) in 
this folder to do it manually
(trust me,it is fun!!).

TO run a script ,you have to be 
in the directory in which it is in
or you can use global address. Give
exectable permission for the .sh
using chmod. You may execute the 
script preferably in Home directory 
'./install.sh' .
