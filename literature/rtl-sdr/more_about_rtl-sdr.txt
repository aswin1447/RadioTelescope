Working with IQ data in Python
******************************
The data received by the rtl
dongle is saved as binary files.
The actual waveform of the signal 
is complex and is called IQ format.
Inorder to derive meaningful data
from the binary file ,we need to
implement some routines in C/C++/python.

This page has some contents related to
python routines.
